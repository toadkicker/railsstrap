Railssstrap
==

railsstrap is a volunteer effort. We encourage you to pitch in.

__*We only accept bug reports and pull requests in GitHub*__. Join the team!

* If you have a support question about how to use the gem, please file an issue and label it as a how_do_i.

* Bug reports should include the following:
  - Minimal example of code to reproduce the bug
  - Stacktrace
  - What you expected to see, and what you actually saw.

* Feature requests should be accompanied by a patch, that includes tests.
* We won't accept any feature requests that come without a patch.
* We use git flow and semantic versions. All pull requests must go to the develop branch or they will be closed.
* Closed bug reporting issues must contain a link to the commit that fixes them, or be labeled as wont-fix.
