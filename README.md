## Why is your gem different?

Railsstrap is more than just another gem providing bootstrap and fontawesome for apps. 
It includes Bootstrap additions that include exotic placements, animations, and other 
component enhancements not included in the official bootstrap release. It also includes 
many HTML helpers and additional javascript components. All of this is exposed to UI 
developers to customize to their liking using either LESS and Coffeescript, or plain 
CSS and Javascript.

How to try it in your browser
=============================

The `examples` folder includes three sample apps that you can rapidly run in
your browser and edit as you please, in order to visually appreciate the result
of Railsstrap.

If youâ€™d like to run the _test Rails app_:

1. Download the source code
1. `cd` into the `examples/rails` folder
1. Run `bundle install`
1. Run `bundle exec rails server`
1. Point your browser to [http://0.0.0.0:3000](http://0.0.0.0:3000)

If you prefer to see the helpers inside a _test Middleman app_:

1. Download the source code
1. `cd` into the `examples/middleman` folder
1. Run `bundle install`
1. Run `bundle exec middleman`
1. Point your browser to [http://0.0.0.0:4567](http://0.0.0.0:4567)

If you prefer to see the helpers inside a _test Padrino app_:

1. Download the source code
1. `cd` into the `examples/padrino` folder
1. Run `bundle install`
1. Run `bundle padrino start`
1. Point your browser to [http://0.0.0.0:3000](http://0.0.0.0:3000)

##Bootstrap additions

###Custom Components
* [Asides](https://github.com/toadkicker/railsstrap/wiki/Bootstrap-Additions#aside) - A modal that slides in from the left or right. Used often in mobile apps for off-screen sidebars or overlays. - New in 3.3.2!
* [Callouts](https://github.com/toadkicker/railsstrap/wiki/Bootstrap-Additions#callout) - Similar to an alert, it is used for drawing attention to content. - New in 3.3.0!
* [Date & Time picker](https://github.com/toadkicker/railsstrap/wiki/Bootstrap-Additions#datepicker--timepicker) - A styled HTML5 datepicker. - New in 3.3.1!
* [Modal enhancements](https://github.com/toadkicker/railsstrap/wiki/Bootstrap-Additions#modal) - animations and real centering placement.
* [Popover enhancements](https://github.com/toadkicker/railsstrap/wiki/Bootstrap-Additions#popover) - animations and custom placements for popover arrows and locations.
* [Tooltip](https://github.com/toadkicker/railsstrap/wiki/Bootstrap-Additions#tooltip) - animations and custom placements for tooltip arrows and locations.

### Animations

Railsstrap comes with over 75 CSS animations. See the wiki or the [vendor/assets/stylesheets/animate](https://github.com/toadkicker/railsstrap/tree/develop/vendor/assets/stylesheets/animate) folder for more info. Also the wiki has detailed instructions on using them.

## Quick rails install
Open your Gemfile, and add the gem to your list of dependencies.

```
gem 'less-rails' #recomended: enables customizing CSS output in railsstrap.
gem 'railsstrap'
```

Then

```
bundle install
```

Most of the info you'll need is in the [wiki](https://github.com/toadkicker/railsstrap/wiki/Installing), and if it isn't please contribute!

## Building the gem

The gem is organized by ruby specific tasks, and front-end specific tasks. `bundle exec rake` will attempt to run the suite of build commands, but you need a few dependencies that are outside of bundler/rubygems's domain.

For compiling stylesheets and javascripts, the gem uses Gruntjs. You'll need node/npm installed to compile them manually. *You do not need to use grunt if you are just referencing specific less/js/coffee files in your rails app*

### Important notes

Railsstrap 3.3.5 is very different from previous releases, and nothing like Twitter-Bootstrap-Rails. 
There is no need to use installers/generators. Everything is covered in a helper and integrates directly with the supported frameworks to output bootstrap formatted html.

- `bootstrap_flash` is gone and replaced with `alert_box`.
- There is no need to add entries in your js/css manifest files. Now you can just do `<%= stylesheet_link_tag font_awesome_css, bootstrap_css, bootstrap_theme_css, railsstrap_css %>` and `<%= javascript_include_tag bootstrap_js %>` 
- For the datepicker, include `<%= javascript_include_tag datepicker_js %>`.
- Minified and unmified versions are available in `vendor/public/stylesheets/railsstrap/<%= Railsstrap::VERSION %>`. The gem provides asset pipeline access in the railsstrap/vendor/assets directory. The helper methods accept a `:host` option as well.
- The datepicker js is in public/javascripts/railsstrap/<%= Railsstrap::VERSION %>/datepicker.min.js. These are provided minified only and includes moment.js.
